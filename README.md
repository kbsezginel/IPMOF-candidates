### Candidate interpenetrating MOFs

![alt text][Fig1]

Here candiate interpenetrating structures discovered by running [IPMOF][IPMOF-ref] algorithm on [CoRE MOF database][CORE-ref] are provided. The cif files are separated in four groups as shown below:

![alt text][Fig2]

- Group 1: Hetero-interpenetarting candidates
- Group 2: Hetero-interpenetrating duplicate structures (degenerate structures of group 1)
- Group 3: Homo-interpenetrating duplicates (degenerate structures of group 4)
- Group 4: Homo-interpenetrating candidates
